          Hello, my name is Matthew Casey! I have always strived to push through
          challenges and think outside of the box. As a former student-athlete
          at the University of Redlands (Cross Country and Track & Field), I was
          able to learn how to adapt to change, learning new strategies on the
          go, and proactive communication with teammates that translates well in
          the workforce. While in school, I was able to gain valuable work
          experience while maintaining responsibilities in sports and fraternity
          work in Delta Sigma Pi's Xi Pi chapter while balancing time with
          studies, sports competitions, and business research. I have the
          aptitude for hard work and dedication to persevere when challenges
          take shape while maintaining a positive mindset. I hope to utilize my
          analytical mindset, competitive background, and curiosity to uphold
          responsibilities and discover opportunities within the tech industry
          using business acumen.
